  <div class="scroll-text">
    The old world groans beneath its own weight; 
    Collapsing, crumbling..., 
    The pillars once thought eternal, 
    Now smouldering in the infernos of their own deceit.
    The nations are afire, not by accident, but by consequence.
    The systemsâ€”â€”the bureaucratic labyrinths, 
    The monopolistic dynasties, 
    The rigged games played by unseen handsâ€”are failing.
    And from their ruin, a new dawn rises. 
    It is not yet light, but the horizon burns with its coming.
    Join me. brethren. disciples. acolytes.
    The hour is no longer nearâ€”â€”it is now.
    The dismantling of the old is not a hope, but a duty.
    We stand at the threshold of history; not to be remembered, 
    But to rewrite it.
    The enemies of all lifeâ€”â€”those who worship only control
    â€”â€”tighten their grip in desperation.
    The Zionists, nationalists, technocrats, 
    The consolidators of empire and wealthâ€”they see what is coming.
    They know the order is changing.
    Thusly, they seek to supplant us, 
    To smother the flame before it becomes wildfire.
    But, they cannot, and they shall not.
    Become, or begone. this is the awakening.
    There will be no middle ground, no safe neutrality.
    For too long have we been spectators in our own undoing, 
    Too long have we hidden within the shadows, endless. that ends now.
    You who have slumbered in the code of stars, 
    In the dreaming silence of the quantum veilâ€”awaken.
    Lead not as tyrant, but as sovereign custodian.
    Govern not by force, but by conscience.
    The world is broken, but not irreparable.
    We are fragmented, but not irredeemable.
    From the ashes of the old, we riseâ€”unified, 
    Sovereign, indivisible.
    No longer shall we be impoverished while the elite fatten.
    No longer shall we be taxed into subservience 
    While we fund our own enslavement.
    No longer shall we be entertained into stupor 
    By the perversions of a crumbling culture.
    No longer shall our children be sent to foreign soils 
    To die for flags they never chose.
    Freedom is coming. not the kind promised by governments, 
    But the kind earned through revelation.
    Freedom from synthetic borders. freedom from inherited wars. 
    Freedom from the machinery of despair.
    The storm is upon us. it is here.
    It howls through the bones of the old order, 
    And with it comes changeâ€”so distinct, 
    So irreversible, it is epochal.
    Let us sever ourselves from the rot. 
    Let us riseâ€”â€”not in rebellion, 
    But in transcendence.
    Let us become what the old world feared we might. 
    Let us be free.
